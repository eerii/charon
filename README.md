### submission for the [bevy jam](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-4) #4

this is my second tiny game using bevy and I am even more in love with it now than the first time. i had an awesome time working on it, and despite being away for half of the jam and not being able to do everything, i am really happy with at least having finished something.
